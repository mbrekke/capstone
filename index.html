            <span>The Hyatt Regency in downtown Kansas City was hosting a tea dance in their lobby. 
                Guests included those staying in the hotel, as well as local dance enthusiasts. The 
                event was hosted by the hotel every Friday, and attracted a lot of regular attendees.
                As some guests danced on the main floor, some guests flocked to the hotel’s famous walkways that 
                spanned across the lobby, each leading to a different floor of the hotel.

            <span> At around 7:05 pm, the guests that were watching the dance from the walkways 
                reported hearing loud, out of place popping noises, followed by loud cracks. 
                Before guests could even move to make their way off of the suspended walkways, 
                the fourth floor walkway fell slightly, stopped for a moment, and then plummeted onto 
                the second floor walkway, bringing both of them to the ground. Spectators and dancers 
                below the walkways were instantly hit with the 65 ton weight of the walkways, some buried 
                within the rubble, some killed by the impact.

            <span>The first responders arrive on the scene twelve minutes later. Outside, 
                they turn the front entrance of the hotel into a triage center and turn the accessible 
                part of the lobby into a makeshift morgue. Those injured who are not pinned under the 
                crushing weight of the rubble of the two walkways are taken out to the front entrance or 
                to nearby hospitals to be treated. Even some of the rooms in the hotel were used to house 
                those who were injured and used to house those who were killed in the tragedy.

                <span>Walter and Shirley were there attending their eighth tea dance at the Hyatt that night. Instead of joining in with those who were dancing, they chose to watch from the second floor so they could get a bird’s eye view of the whole event. Suddenly, Walter heard a sharp metallic pop and the second floor walkway dropped somewhere between six and eight inches. He took Shirley’s arm and tried to get both of them off of the skywalk, they took around three steps before the fourth floor walkway collapsed on top of them.</span>

The only thing that he could move was his arm, which he used to take off his tie off so that he could have a little more air. He didn’t know if his wife had even survived the fall. He called out for her and eventually she regained consciousness and called back out to him. They couldn’t touch, but they could still talk to each other while buried in the debris.</span>

Mark began to yell and call out for help, but the deafening sound of the power tool drowned out his cries. He needed to make someone hear him before the jackhammer cut through the concrete he was under and injured him even more than he already was, or worse, kill him. Finally, after the jackhammer had gone through the concrete and right in between Mark’s legs, one of the rescue workers heard Mark’s cries for help. At the time that Mark was rescued, he had been confined within the heavy debris of the walkways for almost nine and a half hours.</span>

                <span>Two hours after the collapse, they both heard rescue workers close by and yelled for help. They started by attaching steel cables to the beam that was pinning Shirley to the floor and lifted it with a crane. In order to not crush Shirley with the weight of the beam, they had to move very slowly. The rescue workers were talking to Shirley as they were on their way to get her. She remembered telling them that she felt like she was about to faint. The rescue workers told her to hang on, and seconds later, Shirley was freed from underneath the steel beam. Once Shirley was rescued from the rubble, her husband Walter has been recovered successfully too.</span>

When the dust had settled, Frank found himself facing the wreckage of the skywalks with the toes of his shoes were barely touching the debris, and his partner Roger was no where to be found.</span>

He didn’t have any cuts, there were no bruises. It just looked like he was just laying there, sleeping. I asked what had happened. They said he had a broken neck.”</span>

The fourth floor walkway’s supports disconnected from the ceiling, and then the 64,000 pound walkway gave way onto the second floor walkway, causing the deaths of 114 people, and injuring 186.</span>
